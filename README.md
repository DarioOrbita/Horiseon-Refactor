# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

This is a refactoring of the source code for the Horiseon homepage. The code was refactored with the intention of improving its accessability and SEO via updating semantic HTML elements in favor of general DIV elements and consolidating extranneous and duplicate CSS code. Additionally, some funtionality issue were redressed such as a broken links, odd text sizing, and missing img alt descriptions.

The changes in this refactor were made in the spirit of making the codebase and website easier to use for both the end user as well as other developers working on it down the line. With a cleaner codebase, further improvements and changes to the site can be completed significantly faster and with less risk of errors.

## Installation

The repository for this codebase can be found at https://github.com/DarioOrbita/Horiseon-Refactor as well as the deployed webpage at (https://darioorbita.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/).
